### Bots Are Stupid
Price: <span style="color:green">Free</span>

> Ever heard of Robots becoming sentient and taking over humanity? 
> Ridiculous! Bots are extremely stupid! They can’t even make it through a room full of deadly obstacles, nauseating heights and tiny platforms using nothing but a powerful grappling hook - without human support at least. 
> 
> So why not help them?
> 
> “Bots are stupid” is a 2D Platformer/Puzzle Game where instead of using live inputs to control the character, the player has to program precise instructions for his Robots to follow to make it through the level. 
> 
> Step into the role of Central Locomotion Officer in a futuristic factory built to assemble and train the world’s most sophisticated machines since the invention of the Roomba. 
> 
> Your supply of robots is endless so no matter how many crashes and explosions it takes, there is always a way to make it through the test chambers. But remember: the fewer commands the better!

### Vectorio
Price: <span style="color:green">Free</span>
_Early Access_

> Vectorio is a simple survival base-building game where the objective is to claim resources you find around the map and use them to research new powerful weapons and technology. Use your new tech to survive, expand, and defeat all six guardians and put an end to the onslaught of enemy shapes!

> There's more to your base then just the defensive side though. You'll need to carefully plan out not only the design of your front line, but the logistics side of your base as well. Careful power management and building placement is essential if you want to avoid your base running out of power and getting overrun!
