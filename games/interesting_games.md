### Bots Are Stupid
Price: <span style="color:green">Free</span>

> Ever heard of Robots becoming sentient and taking over humanity? 
> Ridiculous! Bots are extremely stupid! They can’t even make it through a room full of deadly obstacles, nauseating heights and tiny platforms using nothing but a powerful grappling hook - without human support at least. 
> 
> So why not help them?
> 
> “Bots are stupid” is a 2D Platformer/Puzzle Game where instead of using live inputs to control the character, the player has to program precise instructions for his Robots to follow to make it through the level. 
> 
> Step into the role of Central Locomotion Officer in a futuristic factory built to assemble and train the world’s most sophisticated machines since the invention of the Roomba. 
> 
> Your supply of robots is endless so no matter how many crashes and explosions it takes, there is always a way to make it through the test chambers. But remember: the fewer commands the better!
